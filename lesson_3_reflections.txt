When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you're collaborating or if you want to access the repository from another machine. You can also use a remote repository for backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some of the changes might not be complete or my local might not be ready for the remote changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a clone of a remote repo and creating another remote repo directly on GitHub. Cloning is creating a copy of a remote repo on local or local to local repo. A branch is a bifurcation of a repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
In case the remote changes, there is the ability to identify those changes and merge accordingly.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would use email. It would be easier because the lineage is easy to follow but it would be harder comparing versions.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
In the event that I want to modify existing code or if I want to introduce new code.
