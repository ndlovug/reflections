When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you're collaborating or if you want to access the repository from another machine. You can also use a remote repository for backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I can decide when it is logical to get changes incase the remote changes might interfere with my local changes.
